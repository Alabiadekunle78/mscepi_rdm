## About the National Malaria Indicator Survey 2019/2020

Cross-sectional household survey in all 22 provinces of Papua New Guinea.

* 5 randomly sampled villages/province
* ca. 30 random households/village
* Structured interviews
* Finger-prick blood sample for malaria diagnosis by Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) and light microscopy

## Questions

Answer the following questions, supported by a table or graph and provide relevant descriptive values.

### Implementation question: How many household interviews were conducted per month?

### Research question 1: Are members of households that own at least one long-lasting insecticidal net (LLIN) less likely to be infected with malaria parasites?

### Research question 2: Does prevalence of Plasmodium vivax and P. falciparum differ between altitudinal zones?

Which provinces have the highest prevalence of Plasmodium vivax infections in children <5 years of age?

### Bonus research question: What is the sensitivity and specificity of RDTs compared to microscopy (any species)?
